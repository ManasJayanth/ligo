description: "\\n\\nPrevented the VSCode plugin from showing a button to download a static Linux binary in MacOS and Windows.If a new LIGO version is available, a pop-up might appear prompting the user to update, but the extension is not launched until that button is interacted with (any button in it is pressed). This behavior has been changed: the extension will be launched independently of the state of the pop-up.\\n"
